The Beatson Institute for Cancer Research is core-funded by Cancer Research UK and provides a dynamic, supportive and well-resourced environment for its basic and translational scientists. Our mission is to understand the mechanisms that regulate cancer cell proliferation, survival and dissemination; to identify critical components of these pathways as targets for novel cancer therapies; and to help translate this knowledge to patient benefit.Â \
\
The Institute is located in a state-of-the-art research building in parkland on the north-western edge of Glasgow and has close ties to the University of Glasgow\'s basic and clinical cancer research groups.
