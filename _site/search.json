Our mission is to understand the mechanisms that regulate cancer cell proliferation, survival and dissemination; to identify critical components of these pathways as targets for novel cancer therapies; and to help translate this knowledge to patient benefit. \n\nThe Institute is located in a state-of-the-art research building in parkland on the north-western edge of Glasgow and has close ties to the University of Glasgow's basic and clinical cancer research groups."
